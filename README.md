#  Meraki Wifi4EU Captive Portal
*Static HTML/JS/CSS Site for a Click-through Splash Page with Wifi4EU tracking snippet integration*




## Overview
The Wifi4EU programme requires the use of a captive portal that connects to the Wifi4EU metrics infrastructure. You can read more about this here: https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/wifi4eu-tracking-snippet-guideline

Cisco Meraki provides cloud managed WiFi with the ability to host your own "Splash Page", which is a captive portal service for authenticating users to join the network. This concept is called an External Captive Portal (ExCaP). 

Meraki provides two splash page modes, **click-through** and **sign-on**. This application will use the click-through method.

To get started just host these files in the public directory on any web server such as Apache or Firebase Hosting and configure your Meraki SSID to use your server. 

Since this is just a starter application. It will authenticate the user on the wirless network but you might still need to "do something" with the submitted form data. This demo simply opens an alert box with the user's name and email address. In reality, you would modify the JavaScript code to save the form data to a database or send a message to an administrator. 

## Installation
* Host the public directory files on a static webserver such as Apache, GitHub or Firebase, or use the included NodeJS express server. 
* Configure the Meraki wireless SSID with a Click-Through splash page authentication
    * Meraki Dashboard --> Configure --> Splash Page: Click-through
* Add the domain address of the webserver and the Wifi4EU resources to the "Walled Garden" 
    * Meraki Dashboard --> Configure --> Access Control --> SSID:yourSSID --> Walled Garden.
    * The domain for the Wifi4EU resources is **collection.wifi4eu.ec.europa.eu**
    * Note: You will need to use the IP addresses associated with these resources instead of their domain names or contact Meraki Support to enable Walled Garden Domain Names
* Point the Meraki Splash page "Customer URL" to the HTML file. `https://yourserver/`
    * Meraki Dashboard --> Configure --> Splash Page --> Custom URL: `https://yourserver.com/splash.html`

* **Option 1:** Static Web Server 
(Apache, nginx, Firebase Hosting)
   * Copy public directory to server
* **Option 2:** NodeJS Server
   * In the root directory of the project, run 
```
npm install
node server.js
```
- The server will host the project on port 5000.
